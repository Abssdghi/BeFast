BeFast is a simple **two-player reaction speed game** built with plain **HTML + JavaScript** and **Tailwind CSS (CDN)**. </br> The game is designed for **turn-based speed challenges** between two players.

## How It Works
1. Players choose a round duration (3–16 seconds).
2. Player A starts the round.
3. When a player finishes their turn, they **tap the screen**.
4. The turn immediately switches to the **next player**.
5. If a player fails to tap before the timer reaches zero, they **lose the round**.

The screen color switches between **Red and Blue** to clearly indicate whose turn it is.

## Use Case
This tool is useful for:
- Fast-paced two-player games
- Reaction speed challenges
- Turn-based physical or verbal games where players must act quickly
